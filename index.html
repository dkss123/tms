                <p class="tms-para"> A transportation management system (TMS) is a subset of supply chain management
                    concerning
                    transportation
                    operations and may be part of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p class="tms-para">
                    A TMS usually "sits" between an ERP or legacy order processing and warehouse/distribution module. A
                    typical
                    scenario would include both inbound (procurement) and outbound (shipping) orders to be evaluated by
                    the
                    TMS
                    Planning Module offering the user various suggested routing solutions. These solutions are evaluated
                    by
                    the
                    user for reasonableness and are passed along to the transportation provider analysis module to
                    select
                    the
                    best mode and least cost provider. Once the best provider is selected, the solution typically
                    generates
                    electronic load tendering and track/trace to execute the optimized shipment with the selected
                    carrier,
                    and
                    later to support freight audit and payment (settlement process). Links back to ERP systems (after
                    orders
                    turned into optimal shipments), and sometimes secondarily to Warehouse Management System (WMS)
                    programs
                    also
                    linked to ERP are also common.

            <p class="inside-tms-para">
                In addition to transportation management, other components of a typical SCM system include procurement,
                product lifecycle management, supply chain planning, order management, manufacturing, inventory, and
                warehouse management.

            <h2 class="tms-heading-2">Why it’s important to have a transportation management system:</h2>
            <p class="inside-tms-para">
                Transportation management systems play a central role in supply chains, affecting every part of the
                process—from planning and procurement to logistics and lifecycle management. The broad and deep
                visibility
                afforded by a powerful system leads to more efficient transportation planning and execution, which
                results
                in higher customer satisfaction. That, in turn, leads to more sales, helping businesses grow. With such
                a
                dynamic global trade environment that we live and transact in, it is important to have a system that
                will
                allow you to successfully navigate complicated processes around trade policies and compliance.

            <h2 class="tms-heading-2">Who Uses a TMS?:</h2>
            <p class="inside-tms-para">
                Transportation management systems are primarily used by businesses that need to ship, move, and receive
                goods on a regular basis, including:
            <ul class="user-list">
                <li>Manufacturers</li>
                <li>Distributors</li>
                <li>Ecommerce companies</li>
                <li>Retail businesses</li>
                <li>Companies that provide logistics services, such as third-party and fourth-party logistics (3PL and
                    4PL)
                    companies and logistics service providers (LSPs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tms-para">
                Businesses in nearly every industry, from construction to life sciences, use a transportation management
                system. The primary users are businesses that spend $100 million or more annually on freight, but the
                availability of cloud-based TMS solutions has made it more affordable for smaller businesses to take
                advantage of the benefits of incorporating a transportation management system into their supply chain.
